# .azdignore - Template initialization inclusions
# This file controls what gets INCLUDED when someone runs 'azd init' from this template
# Uses inclusion-only approach: exclude everything, then selectively include ONLY what's needed to run the application
# Note: This does NOT control packaging - that's handled by .webappignore

# ============================================================================
# RUNTIME-ESSENTIAL INCLUSION APPROACH
# ============================================================================

# 1. Exclude everything by default
*

# 2. Include ONLY files essential for application runtime
!requirements.txt
!app.py
!wsgi.py
!AIPlaygroundCode/config.py
!AIPlaygroundCode/settings.json

# 3. Include ONLY directories essential for application runtime
